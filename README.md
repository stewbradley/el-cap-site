## Introduction

Rebuilding the el cap site from scratch was as much as a learning exercise as anything else. I started with a few React and Next.js components, a few ideas, and the help of the internet and ended up with a full-fledged site that I'm proud of.

Tools used include:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)
- [Prismic](https://prismic.io/)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
